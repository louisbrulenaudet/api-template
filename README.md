## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

The application uses Pydantic Settings for configuration management. Required environment variables (defined in `app/core/config.py`):

- `APP_NAME` (default: "Backend") - Application name
- `API_KEY` - API key for authentication
- `API_CLIENT` - API client identifier

> Note: The API key and API client identifier are not used in this template but are included for future use and example purposes.

### Telemetry and tooling

This project avoids the FastAPI Cloud CLI stack (`fastapi-cloud-cli` / `sentry-sdk`) by depending on `fastapi-cli[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]` with the same “standard” pieces as `fastapi[standard]`. Logfire export is disabled by default via environment variables in the Makefile, Docker, Compose, and CI. **uv** does not document a switch to turn off PyPI User-Agent metadata; see [astral-sh/uv#8474](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8474).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   make sync
   ```

   (`make install` is an alias for `sync`. The `dev` optional extra matches CI: `uv sync --locked --extra dev`.)

2. **Configure environment:**

   Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in required variables:

   ```
   APP_NAME=Backend
   ...
   ```

3. **(Optional) Run with Docker Compose**

   Your `compose.yaml` uses `env_file: .env` to pass these values at **container start** (this is runtime configuration; it is not related to `.dockerignore`).

   Example:

   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   If you want to set values explicitly in YAML (not recommended for real secrets), you can use:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     APP_NAME: "Backend"
     ...
   ```

### Optional: Cloudflare Tunnel (Development Sharing)

If you want to share the API without opening port `8001` to the public internet (e.g. for testing purposes):

- Docker Compose hot-reload workflow: set `TUNNEL_TOKEN` in `.env` and run `make run-dev-tunnel` (tunnel is opt-in via the Compose profile `tunnel`).

In the Compose workflow, `cloudflared` will print the public tunnel URL in the terminal (or via `make tunnel-logs` for the Compose workflow).

3. **Development:**

   ```sh
   make dev
   ```

   - The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Ping endpoint: [http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ping](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ping)

4. **Production:**

   ```sh
   make prod
   ```

   - Production server runs on port 8001 by default at [http://0.0.0.0:8001](http://0.0.0.0:8001)
   - Ping endpoint: [http://0.0.0.0:8001/api/v1/ping](http://0.0.0.0:8001/api/v1/ping)

| `make tunnel-stop`     | Stop Cloudflare Tunnel (keeps app)           |
| `make check-docker`    | Verify Docker installation and configuration |

The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) exposes two targets: `runtime` (uvicorn, dependencies only—what CI builds) and `reload` (same dependency set as `runtime`, but runs `fastapi dev` with reload for local Compose). Optional `[dev]` extras (pytest, ruff, etc.) are for local/CI tooling, not installed in the image.

## Best Practices

- Always validate request/response data using Pydantic models before processing
- Always use DTO objects for data propagation during runtime
- Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
- Use environment variables for configuration and secrets (never hardcode sensitive data)
- Always run `make check` and `make format` before committing
- Use Makefile for common tasks to ensure consistency across the team
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Use utility decorators (`retry`, `async_retry`) for operations that may fail transiently
- Implement proper async/await patterns throughout the application
- Use dependency injection for testability and maintainability
- Document all public functions and classes with docstrings

- **Template / modular development:** Keep components modular and independent to enable parallel work and clean merges

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose for containerization and deployment.
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python dependency manager)
- [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (linter/formatter)

In order to run the backend the fastest way possible, you can use the makefile setup and uv for Python dependency management as this:

```sh
make sync
make update
make dev
```

Then you can ping the API at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ping](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ping).

If you need to install packages such as transformers, you can do so with the following command:

```sh
uv add transformers
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the environment

```sh
make sync
```

### 2. Start FastAPI server

The backend can be run in two modes: development and production. The development mode is intended for local development with hot-reloading, while the production mode is optimized for performance and stability. Here's how to start the development server:

```sh
make dev
```

- The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by default with a ping endpoint at [http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ping](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ping).

### 2.1 Start production server

Here's how to start the production server:

```sh
make prod
```

- The production server will run on port 8001 by default at [http://0.0.0.0:8001](http://0.0.0.0:8001) with a ping endpoint at [http://0.0.0.0:8001/api/v1/ping](http://0.0.0.0:8001/api/v1/ping).

## Code Quality

- Lint and check code:
  ```sh
  make check
  ```

- Format code:
  ```sh
  make format
  ```
